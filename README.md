# SaveTheCastleDemo
## Save the Castle is the current name for the funny boss battle idea.

Save The Castle Demo has a simple introduction, but goes 100% really quickly due to the Demo part being the End of the Game. Sorry :/

Haven't thought of the whole story, so that's why it isn't explained in full here. But the Full Version will have some story and some good stuff. 

Current story as of Demo Inception:

- Jester has enough of King
- Starts sabotaging minor things, befriending everyone and plotting to overthrow
- Overthrows king, locks him in cellar.
- You come along, after these incidents, as the King's relative, you are an Explorer though.
- You battle all of the Corrupted Staff (aka Jester Friends)
- Meet people who are locked away for disagreeing with the Jester.
- Battle the Jester at the End.
- Free the king.

Pretty short, but it'll be expanded for STC Full.

STC Demo will only have a small introduction (demo only, probably), then entering the final room to fight the Jester. Jester has one fight, then you descend to the cellar.

STC Demo only has one of the TWO Jester fights, both will be in STC Full, as follows.

- Beat Jester once with The Entertainer in Minor as the song.
- Beat Jester again (Jester's Encore), with a Rock styled version of the first song.

The full version of STC might be paid, depends on reception of the Demo.

# STC details made public, starting development soon!
